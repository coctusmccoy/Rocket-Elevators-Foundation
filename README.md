# Welcome to Rocket-Elevators-Foundation
Hi here is the repo of our new section added to the rocket elevator website!
So we added a AI section in the header that you can only access if you are an employee or an admin.
Then you have 5 section :  
1. Get All Profiles (This section show you all profile on the Azure Cognitives service)  
2. Speech to text (This section let you convert an audio file to a text)
3. Create Profile (This section will create a profile and give you the ID)
4. Enrollment (This section will ask you for a wav file to link to your profile)
5. Identify (This section will ask you for a wav file to detect if you are in this audio)
